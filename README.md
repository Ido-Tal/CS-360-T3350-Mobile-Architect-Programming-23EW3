## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of the app was to be an inventory tracking app. The app needed for users to be able to register an account for logging in. The app also needed to allow users to add and edit items in the app. Additionally, the app needed to give the user the option to enable SMS notifications, and ask the user to give permissions.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens that I needed where a login, registration, main page, settings page, and edit item page screens. The final UI design kept users in mind by keeping the app simple. Most users who use the app will want a very straightforward experience, and that was the goal of the UI. This UI was successful in that it is very clear and easy to understand what each button prompt does, along with clear color contrast allowing users to easily read the text, and simple navigation.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I wanted to start coding by trying to first create all of the UI pages and then create the code for the functions but as I did that I started to run into various issues. I found myself going backf from writing the code for the functionality of the app to the rewriting the UI pages for the app and making many changes to them, until they ended up looking different than how I thought they would be initially. I referenced back to Zybooks and other online guides on how to work on the connecting the code functionality with the UI as I was having a hard time with it. Referencing online guides and books is a common strategy that I have used in the past and will continued to apply in the future as they can also help in keeping up with the latest practices in the software development.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested by running the built in emulator that Android Studio has. I set the phone to Google Pixel 6 with API 28, which corresponds to Android 9. I would run the emulator and try various things like living log in credentials empty to make sure the app does not log in, or having the wrong password. I would test that the enable notifications turns on and asks for permission, and I would try to add an Item to the inventory. This process is important because it reveals flaws in the functionality, and it also helps to better examine the UI and how well it works with the functionality. As I was testing it revealed to issues with where the code was not behaving the way I wanted it to, and this helped in locating issues.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I was facing a lot of challenges when it came to getting the features in my initial UI design to work properly. In the end I began to rework most of my UI and to make the app simpler for me to develop, more specifically, to simplify the code for the functionality by removing UI features that I deemed less important. I did less innovating and instead narrowed my focus more on simply getting the app achieve the important requirements for the UI and for the functionality.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

In writing the code functionality. This part of the course is a bit more similar to previous classes that I had taken so I already had some experience with writing some code for creating a database file that a program adds and withdraws information from, though there were some differences between those classes and this one.
